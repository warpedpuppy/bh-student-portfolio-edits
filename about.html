        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id="delay">
            My name is Brandon Harris. Having the opportunity to serve and pour into others lives has been transformational. I have been fortunate enough to have had different platforms to reach and teach life lessons of struggle and triumph through sports, arts,
            academics, and recreation. The feeling and joy that comes with being a part of a community and family to achieve something greater than oneself has been amazing. My passion to help others develop does not come from my great successes, but
            rather from my many struggles. Working to serve and enhance others has made me more focused, creative and compassionate.
